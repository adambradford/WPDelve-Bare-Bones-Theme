# WPDelve Bare Bones Theme

A WordPress starter theme for use with the Genesis Framework. Based on the Studiopress [Genesis Sample Theme](https://github.com/copyblogger/genesis-sample)

This was made to suit my individual preferences as a starting point for any new WordPress site. It may not suit everybody, but feel free to use it and change whatever you like.
